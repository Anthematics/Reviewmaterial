NOT A USER STORY
Add a controller to handle requests for books.



App idea:
Cinema booking app that can book seats for a specific movie. Can pick from a selection of movies that display their info/showtimes. Allows for purchasing movie tickets. Should allow for showing ticket/barcode on phone for easier check-in. Allows for purchasing concessions to pick up before the movie. Need to be able to cancel tickets. Can modify showtimes after the fact.
