# OOP - Part 2

Today we'll be going further in depth into Object Oriented Programming to see how we can use objects to create groupings of objects that have similar state and behaviour. We'll also see how you can create state and behaviour that are attached to the class rather than to instances of objects.

## Agenda

* Review of Classes, Objects and Instances (15 mins)
* [Inheritance](#inheritance) (45 mins)
* [Class Variables and Class Methods](#class-variables-and-class-methods) (45-60 mins)
* [Modules](#modules) (0-15 mins)
* Recap (5 mins)

## Inheritance

* Example of Person class: (Student, Instructor) < Person
* Is-a vs Has-a
  * Types of video games (Is-a)
  * Parts of a car (Has-a)

## Class Variables and Class Methods

* Implement Library program

## Modules

* Optional if there is time
